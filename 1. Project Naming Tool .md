# Project Naming Tool  

 

Salesforce has built-in capabilities for naming records. Records can be labeled either numerically by Salesforce, or a user can assign a record name. Depending on the relationship between two objects, a record can list multiple separate record ID fields. Ultimately – especially for larger projects where organization of a record hierarchy is highly important – context for records is highly important; records need context. 

 

The following is the documentation for a small, fast, record-naming feature created to give records more context. The feature is developed using a Before-Save Flow to ensure speed and reduce redundant actions through the Order of Execution. If you’d like to see the feature in action, a URL and Package ID have been included along with post-install instructions below.
